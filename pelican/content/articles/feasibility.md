## Looking for Other Solutions

We noticed that although there had been several research papers written on the subject, the project had never been executed completely. Also, the topic of gesture-controlled writing had been approached, but not a full-blown functional whiteboard. Also, the idea of a collaborative whiteboard was entirely new.

## Approaching an Expert and Formulating the Procedure

We spoke to our WE machine learning expert, Raghava, about the feasibility of our project since it had never been fully done before. He pointed out that the most difficult part would be to detect hands on the camera and track the movement of the hands. He advised us to approach this part of the problem first.

Adhering to his advice, we did plenty of research on Computer Vision and found the library MediaPipe, which had a module dedicated to hand tracking and gesture recognition. This gave us confidence that our project could be done and finalized the project details to pitch to our mentor, Asokan.
