</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Looking for Ideas</h2>
<p>We spent the first few days searching the web for project ideas. After doing some research on artificial intelligence, we were awed by its huge scope. Since we were all interested in the topic, we narrowed our search for projects to AI and ML.</p>
<h2>Finding Inspiration</h2>
<p>When we came across the whiteboard idea, we immediately recognized the need for such an application in our daily lives. The COVID pandemic has caused a drastic shift in the way we visualize teamwork.</p>
<p>With a rise in the number of employees choosing the hybrid style of work, there is a pressing need to replicate the ease of working with people in person in an online environment.</p>
<p>One of the best ways for a team to brainstorm together in person is to have a whiteboard meeting where everyone can draw or write down their ideas. To replicate this in an online meeting becomes a challenge given that not all employees possess the required hardware equipment to achieve this.</p>
<p>This is where we realized that a collaborative gesture-controlled whiteboard was necessary and decided to work on this as our project.</p>
